A take home assignment for Tellie.

# Requirements:

The leadership team has given you an ad-hoc task. It is required by tomorrow, but the sooner the better in their eyes. They want to test a fun new trivia game called Fast Facts. Fast Facts presents players with a series of statements, and they have to decide whether each statement is True or False.

* Create a webpage that lets a creator build an episode of the Fast Facts gameshow.
  
  * The creator should be able to add as many statements as they want and mark the correct answer (True / False).
  
* Create another page that lets a player submit a guess for each statement in the episode, and reveals whether they are right or wrong.

* Episode state (i.e. statements and answer) should not be stored locally on the client.

* The source code needs to be pushed to a public version control system of your choice (e.g. GitHub)
Your project needs to be either (i) hosted and reachable by a public URL, or (ii) dockerized and easy to run locally.
